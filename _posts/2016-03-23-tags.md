[Jekyll Tags][1] provide an option to organize posts based on post's topic. Keywords that capture the essence of the post's topic are applied as tags to the post. Based on this practice, posts having the same tag applied to them are expected to be related. This theory forms the basis of [Tags][2] and [Related Posts][3] features of hydeX.

Tags can be added to a post as part of [Jekyll Front Matter][4]. I recommend using a [YAML List][5] to add multiple tags to a post, as shown below for this post

```yaml
tags:
  - hydeX
  - Features
  - Tags
  - Related Posts
  - GitHub Pages
```

Tags applied to a post are listed in the Tags section at the bottom of the blog post, as shown below

New tags get added to the site wide tags list at the top of the [Tags][2] page. Additionally, the post will show up in the post list for the tags added to the post.

The Related Posts section will list posts that have the most matching tags as the post currently being viewed. The number of posts displayed in Related Posts list is configured by `site.rel_post_count` configuration parameter in the `_config.yml` file. By default, it shows top 3 related posts in the list.

Since [hydeX][6] does not use any [Jekyll Plugin][7] to enable this functionality, this feature works on [GitHub Pages][8] without any issues.
